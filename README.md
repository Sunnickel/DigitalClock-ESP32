A little project I did out of boredom.

The clock connects with a WLAN or an easy Hotspot, gets the current time from a given NTP-Server. 
This then gets shown via the displays. And so that there are not wayyy to many cables,
there is multiplexing to switch between all the number displays.

This is a clock made with the ESP32-S3 and three 7 segment displays and 7 220Î© Resistors.
The whole schematic is in the project too for KiCad.
