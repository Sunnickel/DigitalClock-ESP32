### Why
A little project I did out of boredom.

### What does it do
The clock connects with a WLAN or an easy Hotspot, gets the current time from a given NTP-Server. 
This then gets shown via the displays. And so that there are not wayyy to many cables,
there is multiplexing to switch between all the number displays.

### What does it need
 - ESP32-S3 
 - 3x 2 Digit Seven Segment Display
 - 7x 220 Î© Resistors

### Schematic
